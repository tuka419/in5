Ruthless England thumped Scotland in their final Women's Nations League group match but it was not enough to top the table after the Netherlands scored two injury-time goals against Belgium to deny them in a dramatic finish.

That means the Dutch are through to the Nations League semi-finals and, as a result of England's exit, Team GB now will not be in the Paris 2024 Olympics football competition.

England needed to better the Netherlands' result by three clear goals to reach the Nations League finals and keep Team GB's Olympic hopes alive.

A determined first half saw goals from Alex Greenwood, Lauren James with two and Beth Mead before Fran Kirby made it 5-0 just after the break.
